#Unit 3 Final Assessment

The assessment is two sections: 

###Written Assessment

*This part of the assessment can be found in `Written.m`.*

The written part of the assessment is meant to test your understanding of the Objective-C language and some of the more common classes. This entire section is more or less pass/fail. You're expected to use the provided tests to validate your solutions. You can either choose to run tests individually, or you can choose to run the whole suite at once (`cmd+u`).
